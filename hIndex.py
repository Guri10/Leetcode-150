    Leetcode: 274. H-Index
    Difficulty: Medium
    URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/

    Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
    According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
    and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
    Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

    Example:
    Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
    Output: 3
